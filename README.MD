Hat Sorting Game
=======

Taken from Harry Potter, this C++ program asks 4 questions and stores the answers in variables which are equated to a house name. This is then calculated and the house with the highest score is determined as your house. 

I used a while loop to be able to break from the game if the incorrect answer is given.
