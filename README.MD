Hat Sorting Game
=======

Taken from Harry Potter, this C++ program asks 4 questions and stores the answers in variables which are equated to a house name. This is then calculated and the house with the highest score is determined as your house. 

I have included a While loop over the whole game, so if an incorrect input is presented as an answer (number out of range), then the game explains error and asks to confirm an input before restarting fresh.
